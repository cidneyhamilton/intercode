# Intercode 2

Intercode is a web application that:

* serves as the public-facing web site for a larp convention
* automates signup and payment
* automates business processes for the convention staff

The original Intercode was written in PHP by Barry Tannenbaum for Intercon New England, and has since been used by 
several other conventions around the world.

Intercode 2 is a project to rearchitect Intercode from the ground up, making it more robust, more flexible, and more
modern.
